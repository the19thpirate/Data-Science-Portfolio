## Project 1 : [Stock Portfolio Visualisation Tool](https://github.com/the19thpirate/Portfolio-Visualisation-)

- Tools And Skills Used:
     * Yahoo Finance API,
     * Tkinter for GUI
     * Plotly for Visualisation
     * Sci-kit Learn
     * Numpy and Pandas

- Problem Statement, Analysis & Findings:
     - Majority of investors face the problem of managing their portfolio and lose a lot of time in making decisions due to which would rather be used for finding better positions in the markets. 
     - This tool allows the user to visualise their stock portfolio and other attributes which assist in making decisions on managing their portfolio.
     - (Note : This is made only for personal use and for learning GUI design. The Stock Details which are being showcased in this project are random stocks and  **SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN AS INVESTMENT ADVICE**)


## Project 2 : [Kitchen Appliance Selection (Chimney and Stove)](https://github.com/the19thpirate/Kitchen-Appliances)

- Tools and Skills Used:
     * BeautifulSoup & Selenium for Web Scraping
     * Numpy and Pandas 
     * Matplotlib for Visualization

- Problem Statement, Analysis and Findings:
     - After a recent renovation of the kitchen, there came a problem of installing a new stove and chimney. Each store were selling products from the companies which sponsored    them and the recommendations were highly subjective. So choosing the right product for the kitchen seemed difficult.
     - To get an objective opinion of the products, all stoves and chimneys data was scraped from Amazon for each of the three brands and compared against each other.



## Project 3 : [Explicit Song Analyzer](https://github.com/the19thpirate/Explicit-Song-Analysis)

- Link to Web Application:
[Explicit Song Lyrics Analyser Web Application](https://share.streamlit.io/the19thpirate/explicit-song-analysis/main/hosting.py)

- Tools and Skills Used:
     * Genius API for lyrics extraction
     * Pandas for Data Manipulation
     * NLTK for text mining
     * Textblob for Sentiment Analysis
     * Streamlit for Hosting Web Application

- Problem Statement, Analysis and Findings:
     - In 1985, the lead singer of Twisted Sister, Dee Snider had been summoned by the American Congress because the Parents Music Resource Center had singled them and a few       other artists for for ostensibly making obscene music.
     - The accusations were quickly falsified by the lead singer who also taught the American Congress on how to introduce songs to children.
     - This tool helps the user to find whether there are explicit words that might be present in current day top songs. Furthermore, this tool helps the user to understand        other aspects of the song by giving recommendations.
     - The other recommendations come on the basis of these results which can be considered by the user when recommending the song they've analysed :


## Hackathons: BWAI Zero Waste Hunger Management 

- Tools And Models Used:
     - ARIMA 
     - Seasonal ARIMA
     - Exponential Smoothing
     - Streamlit
     - VSCode and Jupyter Notebook as IDE.
 

- Models Used for Interface:
     - ARIMA.

- Problem Statement:
     - Zero Waste Hunger Management
          - How NGO's can leverage AI Just in Australia, 7.3 million tones of food is lost or wasted, estimated to be 298 kg per capita per year.
          - At the same time, over 5 million Australians experience food insecurity each year. Traditionally NGOs are not equipped or funded to use the latest AI Data Driven   Technology to help provide these services efficiently with the best consumer experience.

- Solution:
     - Using Time Series Forecasting for Product Storage Management 
     - This helps partners and communities to manage food requirements and donations for 5 days into the future so food wastage can be reduced.
